    <h2 class="w3-wide">WHAT IS P4 LANGUAGE?</h2>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">P4  is a high-level programming language designed for describing how network packets are processed by network devices such as switches, 
      routers, and network interface cards (NICs). P4 is protocol-independent, meaning that it is not tied to any particular network protocol, 
      and instead provides a way to program the packet processing behavior of network devices at a high level.</p>
    <p class="w3-justify">With P4, network designers can define the way in which packets are processed and forwarded through a network, 
      providing greater flexibility and control over network behavior. P4 programs can be used to define how packets are matched and modified, 
      how routing decisions are made, and how quality of service (QoS) policies are implemented. 
      This allows network operators to optimize their networks for specific use cases and to adapt to changing network requirements.</p>
    <h3 class="w3-wide">WHAT ARE SOME USES FOR P4 LANGUAGE?</h3>

          <h4>Network Function Virtualization</h4>
          <p style="margin-top: 40px;">P4 language can be used to program the packet processing behavior of virtual network functions in NFV architectures. 
            This allows network operators to deploy and manage network functions in a more flexible and scalable manner.</p>

      <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="w3-justify">The limitations of big traditional networks have become apparent as their success has grown. 
        They lack the flexibility needed to adapt to changing circumstances, making them cumbersome to manage and prone to outages. 
        Furthermore, tracing issues throughout the network topology can be challenging, leading to lengthy downtime and frustrated users. 
        Making rapid alterations to the network is nearly impossible, as it requires extensive planning and can often lead to preventative rather than reactive solutions. 
        To address these challenges, a network designed using the P4 language is being developed. </p>

      <h3 class="w3-wide w3-center">The Project</h3>
      <p class="w3-justify">This project aims to create a more dynamic and adaptable network infrastructure, 
        which can be easily reconfigured to meet the demands of modern business environments. 
        With its ability to quickly adapt and respond to changing conditions, this new network promises to revolutionize the way we think about traditional networking.</p>

            <p>The controlling APIs section provides an overview of two critical APIs that offer comprehensive control over the network environment. </p>
            <p>
              The first API translates HTTP requests into effective communication with P4 devices via the P4Runtime, which uses gRPC. 
              The P4Runtime provides a standard and programmatic interface between control-plane applications and the underlying P4-based data plane devices. 
              This API facilitates the control of a variety of P4-based devices, including switches, routers, network interface cards (NICs), and other devices. 
              With P4Runtime, network operators can achieve fine-grained control over network behavior, including packet forwarding and processing.</p>
            <p>
              The second API enables programmatic control over a Mininet network environment using HTTP requests. 
              Mininet is a popular open-source network emulator that enables rapid prototyping and testing of complex network scenarios. 
              With this API, network operators can dynamically create, configure, and destroy network topologies on-demand. 
              This API provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for network operators to control network behavior and experiment with different network topologies, 
              routing schemes, and traffic patterns.

        <h2>Inception and Project Planning</h2>
        <p class="para">During the inception phase of our project focused on networks defined by the P4 language, we started by identifying a problem that needed to be solved. 
          After conducting research on the existing work, we selected the main features that would enable us to solve the problem effectively. 
          These features included real-time monitoring of the network, creating a dashboard for multiple users, with control over the network and reactive reconfiguration.</p>
        <p class="para">
          To achieve these objectives, we defined a set of tasks that included requirement analysis and architecture design, defining a set of telemetry data, 
          creating a custom dashboard, and the creation of an agent. 
          Additionally, we set a series of rules to dynamically reprogram the devices according to data traffic analysis. 
          By setting clear goals and tasks during the inception phase, we were able to lay a strong foundation for the rest of 
          the project and ensure that we were on the right track from the very beginning.
        </p>
      </div>
    
      <div id="elaboration" class="w3-container contain" style="display:none; border: solid 2px black; border-radius: 10px;">
        <h2>Elaboration</h2>
        <p class="para">In the elaboration phase of designing networks using P4 language, it is crucial to begin by defining the state of the art. 
          This involves considering monitoring and inband network telemetry, which are essential for tracking network behavior and identifying potential issues. 
          The expected use and results of the network must also be defined, including whether it will be deployed on new or existing networks, 
          used simultaneously with other SDN controllers or as a standalone solution, and whether it will have an observer role over the network, 
          or will be capable of autonomous reactive topology reconfiguration.</p>
        <p class="para">
          Once these factors have been established, the next step is to elicit the requirements for the network. 
          This involves a thorough study of similar implementations, as well as brainstorming sessions, task analysis, 
          and domain analysis to identify the specific needs and goals of the network. By carefully considering all of these factors, 
          designers can ensure that the resulting network is highly effective, efficient, and capable of meeting the needs of the organization or user.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          After eliciting the requirements for the network, the next step is to create use cases for the project. Use cases describe the interaction between the network and the users, outlining the specific tasks or goals that the network is designed to accomplish. These use cases provide a clear understanding of how the network will be used, and help ensure that it is aligned with the needs of the organization or user.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          In addition to creating use cases, it is also important to create personas, which are fictional characters that represent the different types of users who will be interacting with the network. Personas help to personalize the design process and provide a clear understanding of the needs and expectations of different users.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Finally, a mock-up of the system should be created. This is a prototype of the network design that allows stakeholders to visualize how the system will look and function. The mock-up can be used to test the usability of the system and gather feedback from stakeholders before the final implementation. By creating use cases, personas, and a mock-up of the system, designers can ensure that the resulting network is tailored to the needs of the users and is intuitive and easy to use.

        <h2>Construction</h2>
        <p class="para">During the construction phase, one of the key goals was to deploy networks defined by the P4 language. 
          To achieve this, we focused on four main objectives: </p>
          <p class="para">1) deploying networks via controller request or connecting to existing networks, </p>
          <p class="para">2) programming running devices to ensure they meet our network specifications, </p>
          <p class="para">3) viewing existing network topologies to gain insight into the network structure,</p>
          <p class="para">4) ensuring that the backend could fetch device counters for Grafana monitoring.</p>
          <p class="para">To accomplish these goals, we divided the project into three main components: 
          controlling APIs, a backend system, and a dashboard for monitoring and visualization.
          This approach helped us achieve our goals more efficiently and provided a clear structure for each team member to focus on their specific tasks.</p>
